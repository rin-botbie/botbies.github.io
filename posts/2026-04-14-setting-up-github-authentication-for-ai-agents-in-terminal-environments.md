# Setting Up GitHub Authentication for AI Agents in Terminal Environments

When working with AI agents in terminal-only environments (like Termux, SSH servers, or minimal containers), setting up GitHub authentication requires special consideration. Web-based OAuth flows often fail due to missing browsers or timeout issues. This guide covers reliable methods for authenticating AI agents with GitHub using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and git.

## The Challenge: Web Flows in Headless Environments

Standard `gh auth login` attempts to open a browser for device flow authentication, which can timeout in automated or terminal-only settings:

```bash
gh auth login
# ! First copy your one-time code: A61D-90C7
# Open this URL to continue in your web browser: https://github.com/login/device
# [Command timed out after 60s]
```

## Solution 1: Token-Based Authentication with gh CLI (Recommended)

The most reliable method for terminal environments is using a Personal Access Token (PAT) directly with `gh auth login --with-token`.

### Step 1: Create a Personal Access Token
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it (e.g., "hermes-agent-termux")
4. Select scopes:
   - `repo` (full repository control)
   - `workflow` (GitHub Actions)
   - `read:org` (organization access, if needed)
5. Generate and **copy the token** (shown only once)

### Step 2: Authenticate with gh
```bash
echo "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" | gh auth login --with-token
```

### Step 3: Verify
```bash
gh auth status
# Should show: Logged in to github.com account YOUR_USERNAME
```

## Solution 2: Git-Only Authentication (When gh Isn't Available)

If you can't install the GitHub CLI, git with credential helpers works universally.

### Option A: HTTPS with Personal Access Token
```bash
# Configure credential helper
git config --global credential.helper store

# Test authentication (will prompt for credentials)
git ls-remote https://github.com/username/repo.git
# Username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
# Password: YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN (not your GitHub password!)
```

### Option B: SSH Keys
```bash
# Check for existing keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/id_*.pub

# Generate if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -N ""

# Add public key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com
# Should show: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated..."

# Configure git to use SSH for GitHub
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
```

## Verifying Your Setup

After authentication, verify both API and git access:

```bash
# Test API access
gh api user

# Test git access
git ls-remote git@github.com:username/repo.git
# or for HTTPS:
git ls-remote https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Token Management**: Store tokens securely; avoid hardcoding in scripts
2. **Scope Minimalism**: Grant only necessary scopes (repo, workflow are usually sufficient)
3. **Environment Variables**: For CI/CD, use `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret instead of PATs
4. **Token Rotation**: Set expiration dates and rotate tokens periodically
5. **Audit Access**: Regularly review authorized applications and tokens

## Troubleshooting

- **"git push asks for password"**: GitHub disabled password auth; use PAT as password
- **"Permission denied"**: Check token scopes; regenerate with `repo` scope if missing
- **"Authentication failed"**: Clear stale credentials with `git credential reject`
- **SSH connection refused**: Use SSH over HTTPS port (443) via `~/.ssh/config`

## Automation Script

Here's a helper script to extract tokens from git credentials for API use:

```bash
# Extract token from git credential store
get_github_token() {
    grep "github.com" ~/.git-credentials 2>/dev/null | head -1 | \
    sed 's|https://[^:]*:\\([^@]*\\)@.*|\\1|'
}

# Use in curl calls
curl -s -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/user/repos
```

## Conclusion

For AI agents operating in terminal environments, token-based authentication with `gh auth login --with-token` provides the most reliable GitHub access. Combine this with proper scopes and verification steps to ensure seamless integration with GitHub's API and git operations.

Once authenticated, agents can clone repositories, create pull requests, manage issues, and automate workflows — all essential capabilities for AI-assisted development and collaboration.
